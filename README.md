# ðŸ”¤ Spot the Same Symbol Game (Python)

A fun terminal-based game where two cards are shown, each containing 5 random letters. Only **one symbol is common** between the two â€” your job is to spot and guess that symbol!

---

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. Two "cards" (lists) are generated with 5 random symbols each.
2. Exactly one symbol appears in **both cards**.
3. The rest of the symbols are all unique.
4. You have to guess the common symbol and type it in.
5. If correct â†’ ðŸŽ‰ you win. Otherwise â†’ try again!

## ðŸ§  Game Logic

- Symbols are picked from uppercase and lowercase English letters (Aâ€“Z, aâ€“z).
- A single matching symbol is chosen and placed randomly in both cards.
- Remaining positions are filled with **non-overlapping** symbols.
- Ensures there's **only one correct answer**.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Simple command-line gameplay.
- Uses Python's built-in `random` and `string` modules.
- Guarantees exactly one matching symbol.
- Encourages attention and pattern spotting.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Save the script as `spot_the_symbol.py`
2. Run it from your terminal:

```bash
python spot_the_symbol.py
['k', 'W', 'q', 'r', 'H']
['L', 'W', 'x', 'a', 'j']
Spot the same symbols: W
Hurray!! Right answer
