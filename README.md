# Spot-The-Error
ðŸ”¤ Spot the Same Symbol Game (Python)
A fun little terminal-based game where two cards are generated with random symbols. Only one symbol is common between the two cards â€” your goal is to spot and guess that symbol!

ðŸŽ® How to Play
Two cards are displayed, each with 5 randomly chosen symbols.

Exactly one symbol is the same in both cards â€” either in the same or different position.

Your job is to spot the common symbol and type it in.

If your guess is correct, you win. Otherwise, try again later!

ðŸ§  Game Logic
Uses Python's random and string modules.

Picks a random matching symbol for both cards.

Fills the rest with unique, non-overlapping random symbols.

Guarantees only one match between the two cards.

ðŸ›  Features
Pure Python â€” no external libraries required.

Dynamic symbol selection from string.ascii_letters.

Only one common symbol between the two cards.

Simple terminal input/output interface.

ðŸš€ How to Run
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Save the code in a file, for example: spot_the_symbol.py

Run it in your terminal or any IDE:

bash
Copy
Edit
python spot_the_symbol.py
ðŸ“¦ Sample Output
less
Copy
Edit
['q', 'A', 'g', 'x', 'K']
['v', 'A', 's', 'j', 'h']
Spot the same symbols: A
Hurray!! Right answer
ðŸ’¡ Possible Improvements

Add a score system for correct/incorrect guesses.

Include a time limit for added challenge.
